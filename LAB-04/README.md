I have implements a modified K-Means clustering algorithm using **Manhattan distance**.

- 100 random Cartesian points are generated.
- 10 random initial cluster centers are generated.
- Clustering continues until cluster centers stabilize.
- Visualization is done using a 2D matrix printed with `print()`.
  - `*` represents a data point.
  - `C` represents a cluster center.

## Files

- `kmeans_manhattan.py` — Main source code
- `data.txt` — Auto-generated data file containing points and clusters

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries needed

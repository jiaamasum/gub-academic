# AI Lab Assignment â€“ Graph Coloring & Maze Solver

Here I have solved 2 problems. 
###  The first one ('backtr.py') solves the Graph Coloring problem using backtracking. 
It reads a graph from an input text file and checks if it's possible to color the graph using at most `k` colors such that no two connected nodes share the same color. 

###  The second one ('mazeiddfs.py') solves a maze using the Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS) algorithm. 
It takes a grid input where '0' is a walkable cell and '1' is a wall and finds a path from a given start to a target position if possible. 

Both codes are interactive and take input from the user or file as needed. 

### ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s Inside?

1. **Graph Coloring using Backtracking ('backtr.py')**  
This program solves the graph coloring problem using the backtracking algorithm. 
It takes a graph input from a text file, along with the number of colors `k` and checks if itâ€™s possible to assign colors to each node so that no two adjacent nodes share the same color.

2. **Maze Solver using Iterative Deepening DFS ('mazeiddfs.py')**  
This program uses the Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS) algorithm to find a path in a maze from a given start point to a target. 
The maze is represented as a grid where '0' indicates a free cell and '1' indicates a wall.

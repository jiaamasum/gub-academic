# N-Rooks Problem Solver üè∞‚ôú

A simple Python script to solve the classic **N-Rooks** problem: placing `N` rooks on an `N√óN` chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other. Rooks attack in straight lines ‚Äî horizontally and vertically ‚Äî so this solution ensures one rook per row and per column.

## üîç Problem Statement

Place **N rooks** on an **N√óN** chessboard so that:
- No two rooks are in the same row
- No two rooks are in the same column

Output a valid configuration using `1`s (for rooks) and `0`s (for empty cells).

## üß† Approach

We place a rook at position `(i, i)` for all rows `i`. This ensures:
- Each row has exactly one rook
- Each column has exactly one rook  
This is one of many valid solutions.

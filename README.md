# PythonIntro - LabPerformance01

Here i have solved 8 Python problems from the lab 01 with tasks such as arithmetic operations, loops, and functions. 

## Problem List & Descriptions

1. **Sum of Odd and Even Numbers from a Set of Numbers**  
   - Prompts the user to enter a set of numbers and calculates the sum of odd and even numbers separately.

2. **Find the Smallest Number from a Set of Numbers**  
   - Prompts the user to enter a set of numbers and determines the smallest among them.

3. **Sum of All Numbers Between 50 and 100 Divisible by 3 and Not Divisible by 5**  
   - Calculates the sum of all numbers between 50 and 100 that are divisible by 3 but not by 5.

4. **Find the Second Highest Number from a Set of Numbers**  
   - Prompts the user to enter a set of numbers, removes duplicates, and determines the second highest number.

5. **Find the Factorial of a Number Using a For Loop**  
   - Calculates the factorial of a user-provided non-negative integer using a for loop.

6. **Generate Fibonacci Series**  
   - Generates the Fibonacci series for a specified number of terms.

7. **Find the Largest Number Between Two Numbers Using a Function**  
    - Contains a function that compares two numbers and returns the larger one.

8. **Find the Sum of the Numbers Passed as Parameters**  
    - Contains a function that calculates the sum of an arbitrary number of parameters.

## File Structure

Each problem is implemented in a separate Python file for clarity. The files are contains as follows:

- Sum of odd and even numbers
- Find the smallest number
- Sum of numbers (50-100) divisible by 3 and not 5
- Find the second highest number
- Factorial using a for loop
- Fibonacci series generator
- Find the largest number using a function
- Sum of numbers passed as parameters
